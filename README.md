# Simple webcounter page

This is simple webcounter page written on python, provisioned by packer and vagrant. **Packer** is a free and open source tool for creating golden images while **vagrant** enables users to create and configure lightweight, reproducible, and portable development environments.
In our case we will use **packer** to create and virtualbox image that we will provision and configure with **vagrant**.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

You should install the following software

```
git -> https://git-scm.com/downloads
packer -> https://www.packer.io/downloads.html
vagrant -> https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
virtualbox -> https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
```

### Getting the code

First we have to get the code. Open you terminal and perform the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/yaroslav-007/webcounter2.git
```

This will download the project in your current directory in folder named **webcounter2**. Change you location to that folder.

```
cd webcounter2
```




## Building the virtual machine and run the code

We will build a base image, will add it in virtualbox and upload the setting into the created machine. As a result will have a simple web site running on **localhost** on port **8000** that counts the number of times the page was accessed.

### Break down into end to end tests


First we will use packer to create base virtualbox image for the project.

```
packer build bionic64.json
```

After the box is build we will use vagrant to run the box image we have created and import the settings for the app.
```
vagrant up
```
After vagrant builds the vm, you should be able to access http://localhost:8000.
